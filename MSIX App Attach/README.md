# MSIX app attach preview 

This repository contains samples to showcase APIs for implementing MSIX app attach. 

Due to this being a preview Microsoft does not offer support for MSIX app attach. All support efforts are community driven. 

Please reference Getting started with MSIX app attach in Windows Virtual Desktop (Preview) document for details on MSIX app attach.

  - Where \\ads01\Configuration\WVD\MSIX\ is the path to the script and \\ads01\Configuration\WVD\MSIX\AppAttach.json the JSON-configuration file.

- Make sure that the GPO is linked to the computer and enable loopback processing:

- Computer Configuration - Policies - Administrative Templates - System/Group Policy

  - Configure user Group Policy loopback processing mode: Enable - Mode: merge.

## Preparing the golden master for the session hosts
To work with MSIX and have the script do the work you have to prepare your golden image:

- Make sure that you have installed the right version from the insider build

- Double-check that you have NOT prepared your image with the command line commands described in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/app-attach#prepare-the-vhd-image-for-azure (Disable Store auto-update and so on). Itâ€™s only for the VM concerning the converting process.

- Copy the PSTools https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec to %Windir%\System32 (you need psexec later)

- Give the service GPSVC the right privileges to mount images:

  - Create a cmd-file with this content:
```
sc privs gpsvc SeManageVolumePrivilege/SeTcbPrivilege/SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege/SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege/SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege/SeSecurityPrivilege/SeChangeNotifyPrivilege/SeCreatePermanentPrivilege/SeShutdownPrivilege/SeLoadDriverPrivilege/SeRestorePrivilege/SeBackupPrivilege/SeCreatePagefilePrivilege
```
  - Open an administrative cmd and execute:
```
psexec /s cmd
```
  - In this service cmd execute the cmd-file to give GPSVC the right permissions

(This adds the SeManageVolumePrivilege which allows mounting of images)
